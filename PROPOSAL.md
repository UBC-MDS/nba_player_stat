## Motivation and Purpose


The motivation behind this project is to help NBA fans better understand their favorite players and visualize how the players have performed historically over time and across teams. Further, this helps NBA fans to make better decisions when betting. On the other hand, we can also honor those former superstars, such as Kobe Bryant, by visualizing them. We can learn about the wonders the legendary superstar created with the Lakers and the glory of the purple and gold dynasty. A tribute to the eternal Lakers #24.
