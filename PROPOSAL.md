## Motivation and Purpose


The motivation behind this project is to help NBA fans better understand their favorite players and visualize how the players have performed historically over time and across teams. Since the NBA has a long history and team changes are a regular occurrence, it was necessary to create a data visualization app that could cover all 30 teams in the NBA.

Further, it helps NBA fans make better decisions when betting, as the clustering visualization of player data helps fans give basic judgments on player performance levels. Fans can determine a player's style of play by where he scores most often, how he scores most often, the number of assists, etc., and use this as a starting point to get to know a new player.

On the other hand, we can also honor those former superstars, such as Kobe Bryant, by visualizing their performance. We can learn about the wonders the legendary superstar created with the Lakers and the glory of the purple and gold dynasty. Salute to the eternal Lakers #24.

## Primary research question and usage scenarios

The project aims to answer the following primary question:
How can we understand a NBA player's historical performance and the type of role he plays on the court?
Below is an example of usage scenario from a member of our target audience.

Tom is an enthusiast NBA fan and playing sports betting in his spare time. He is interested with assessing NBA players based on their performance in the previous NBA games. The dashboard developed from this project provides statistics data visualization covering basketball players from all 30 teams in the NBA. Tom is able to search a particular player by their name, filter their performance data by specifying the year, quarter, and corresponding team names, then he can easily check the player's statistics, such as points per game, shooting accuracy, and skill indicators. The dashboard is a handy tool for him to make betting decisions through the data-driven approach.
